	<p>Hello there! My name is John Dunham and I love making games! My background is in Computer Science, but my passion lies in the development of user experience and terrain for interactive experiences. 
	At the present I am pursuing my Masters at RIT's school of Interactive Games and Media, predominantly researching procedural generation and terrain rendering. 
	If you think you'd be interested in the journey give my <a href="http://www.johndunhamgames.com/blog">Research Blog</a> a once over and be sure to tell me what you think!</p>			
	<p>If you just can't get enough of me I also have a <a href="https://github.com/mew2057/">github account</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jfdunham">linkedin account</a> (Don't forget to add me!).</p>
	
	<p> If you see a project that doesn't have public code, but you want to check it out feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:john@johndunhamgames.com">john@johndunhamgames.com</a>. I'd be more than happy to share.</p>
